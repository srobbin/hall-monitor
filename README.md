# Hall Monitor

A simple Chrome extension that helps keep kids focused during school.

## Backstory

Much like the rest of the world, we've been homeschooling our kids. And during this time, YouTube has been somewhat of a distraction (i.e., our kids have been watching it instead of paying attention during class).

From what I can tell, there's no great way to deal with this problem. We can't block YouTube outright, because some of their teachers use it for class. So, instead, I created this Chrome extension.

## How it works

- Try to visit youtube.com directly, and you'll see a message saying `Sorry, you can't watch YouTube right now.`.
- Try to visit a YouTube link from Google search results, and you'll see the same message.
- Click on a link from the teacher (or a direct link) and you'll see the video but nothing else (i.e., all of YouTube's search bars and recommended videos will be hidden).

## Notes

I understand that it's easy for kids to get around this, but thankfully my kids don't know how. If you can think of a way to improve this plugin, please contribute!
